    "There are a lot of tools for testing in Python. So much so that it could take several sessions over different days to go over all of them, so to make the most of your time, we'll go over a selected few of the ones below.\n",
    "- Code Formatting\n",
    "    - [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): This is what you call a code linter. These are tools designed to help you enfore a style for writing code, and, depending on its internals, you can make it optional or compulsory to stick to its style convetion. It's is a great tool to get started testing your code.\n",
    "    - [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): \"By using Black, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.\"\"\n",
    "- General Code Functionality\n",
    "    - [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/): The workhorse of testing in Python writes a very humbly definition. \"The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.\"\n",
    "    - [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html): \"Mypy is a static type checker for Python 3. If you sprinkle your code with type annotations, mypy can type check your code and find common bugs. As mypy is a static analyzer, or a lint-like tool, the type annotations are just hints for mypy and don‚Äôt interfere when running your program.\"\"\n",
    "    - [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/): \"Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations. pydantic enforces type hints at runtime, and provides user friendly errors when data is invalid.\"\n",
    "- Data\n",
    "    - [pandas.testing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/testing.html): A submodule of the pandas package with a few useful assertions, exceptions, and warnings to make it easier to write tests.\n",
    "    - [great_expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/): Arguably the best tools out there for testing data. In their own words, \"Great Expectations is the leading tool for validating, documenting, and profiling your data to maintain quality and improve communication between teams. Head over to our getting started tutorial. Software developers have long known that automated testing is essential for managing complex codebases. Great Expectations brings the same discipline, confidence, and acceleration to data science and data engineering teams.\"\n",
    "- Property-based Testing\n",
    "    - [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): \"Hypothesis is a Python library for creating unit tests which are simpler to write and more powerful when run, finding edge cases in your code you wouldn‚Äôt have thought to look for. It is stable, powerful and easy to add to any existing test suite. It works by letting you write tests that assert that something should be true for every case, not just the ones you happen to think of.\"\n",
    "- Environment Testing\n",
    "    - [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/#): \"tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you can use for: checking that your package installs correctly with different Python versions and interpreters, running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice, acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note 1:** Most of the definitions above have been taken out straight from the documentation.  \n",
    "**Note 2:** We are not using all of the packages above in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many more tools tools to explore so I'll leave the rest to you and your future PyCon talk or workshop. üòâ"
