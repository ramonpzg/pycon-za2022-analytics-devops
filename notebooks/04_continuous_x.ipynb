    "6. Navigate to GitHub, log in, and create a new repository by clicking on top right-hand corner.\n",
    "7. Add a `README.md` file with `echo \"# pycon-za-test\" >> README.md`\n",
    "8. Let's view what we have and start tracking our files `git status && git add .`\n",

    "    7. Now we can use `dvc config core.autostage true` to stop adding each step individually.\n",
    "    8. Another one `dvc run -n split_data -d src/split_data.py -d data/02_part/interim/clean_data.parquet -o data/02_part/processed/train.parquet -o data/02_part/processed/test.parquet python src/split_data.py`\n",

    "    11. We can evaluate what our dag of steps looks like with `dvc dag`.\n",
    "    12. Now we can run it with `dvc repro`. If we make any changes to a step in the pipeline, the previous steps that were not changed will not get rerun as their ourput gets cached in memory.\n",
